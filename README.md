Ranking and Analysis of Trade Performance
This research rates the accounts according to a number of financial factors after analyzing historical trading data from Binance accounts. Calculating key performance indicators (KPIs), ranking the accounts appropriately, and offering insights into each account's performance are the main objectives. Metrics like ROI (Return on Investment), Win Rate, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) are used in the study to rank accounts and assess their performance.
Overview
An analytical framework for ranking Binance accounts according to their trading performance is provided by this project. The following are the primary metrics used to assess the accounts:
Return on Investment, or ROI
Sharp Ratio ,Win Rate ,Maximum Drawdown (MDD)
These indicators are computed by the project, which then ranks the accounts according to their overall performance.
Calculated Metrics
For every account, the following metrics are computed:
Return on Investment, or ROI, calculates the total return in relation to the original investment. Better profitability is indicated by a greater ROI.
Win Rate: The proportion of successful trades to all deals. This demonstrates how consistently the account has been successful.
The Sharpe Ratio calculates the return adjusted for risk. It displays the account's profitability in relation to the risk (volatility) it takes on.
The biggest possible loss prior to a recovery is shown by the biggest Drawdown (MDD), which is the largest peak-to-trough decrease in the account's value.
In conclusion
A strong framework for assessing and prioritizing trading accounts according to important financial parameters is offered by this research. Traders or investors may utilize the insights produced to evaluate the performance of Binance accounts and make well-informed decisions based on drawdowns (MDD), risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio), consistency (Win Rate), and return on investment (ROI).
